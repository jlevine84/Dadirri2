# Dadirri - Project 3 - Team 1

Contributors:  Carlar Blackman, Kendall Davis, Jeff Levine, Lesley Pond, Jamil Weeks.

Project Name: Dadirri

Topic/Idea: Dadirri is a full-stack application utilizing all the skills we have learned during our Bootcamp experience. Our Application is aimed towards people who want to track their mental health in an easy to use and helpful manner. To achieve those goals, our Application will allow users to sign in and log helpful information that they can use to keep track of their mood and progress through their mental health issues. We aim to provide the users with a place to keep track of: a daily dairy, mood, energy, anxiety, exercise, sleep, and other useful utilities to reflect on their overall progress.

New Technologies: New CSS framework. Graphing capabilities. React libraries.

Mission: Dadirri, by definition, is an Aboriginal term meaning, “A state of stillness, inner reflection, and deep listening,” and we aim to help our users by providing them a platform in which to do so.
